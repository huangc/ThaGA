## Agenda of ThaRegGA development and application:
1. prove of concept using target genes LRK and Sub1: 
   * (a). TRegGA of target gene with rice indica 93-11 reads against reference japonica. (b). TRegGA of target gene with rice indica 93-11 reads against reference using denovo assembled superscaffolds from haplovars (manually selected) on the target gene.
   * Comparison of result (a) and (b) to 93-11 reference: result (b) should be closer to ref 93-11 than result (a) due to the use of ThaRegGA.
2. develop algorithm for identifying haplotypes of a target gene from 3kRGP
3. repeat of Aim1 with developed algorithm for ThaRegGA.

## Agenda of ThaRegGA application on finding Xa7 gene.

## Target region:
1. M5_M5-56K in rice japonica is chr6:27,965,437..28,022,337, Length=56,901 bp. 
2. M5_M5-56K in rice indica is chr6:29,683,670..29,828,319, Length=144,650 bp.
