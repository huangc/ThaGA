## Agenda of ThaRegGA development and application:
1. prove of concept using a target gene (TBD) and: 
   * (a). TRegGA of target gene with rice indica 93-11 reads against reference japonica. (b). TRegGA of target gene with rice indica 93-11 reads against reference using denovo assembled superscaffolds from haplovars (manually selected) on the target gene.
   * Comparison of result (a) and (b) to 93-11 reference: result (b) should be closer to ref 93-11 than result (a) due to the use of ThaRegGA.
2. develop algorithm for identifying haplotypes of a target gene from 3kRGP
3. repeat of Aim1 with developed algorithm for ThaRegGA.
4. Application of ThaRegGA on finding Xa7 gene.
