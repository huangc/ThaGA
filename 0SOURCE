## Parameters for finding DFP [1] of samples in order to evaluate the proportion of shared deletion sites [2] among them.
# [1] Deletion Fingerprints (DFP): Set of deletions of the assembled contigs when compared to the reference genome. 
#     To reduce the noise, we define DFP as the deletions that are located in the genic region (iloci).
# [2] Shared deletion site: the deletion site has EXACT start and end position in the reference for the compared samples.
